# bulletin-board-system

**Description**

> * In this project we will be simulating a news bulletin board system. 
> * In this system there are several processes accessing the system, either getting the news from the system or updating the news. 
> * The system will consist of a server that implements the actual news bulletin board and several remote clients that communicate with the server using the JAVA.Sockets or JAVA.RMI.
> * The remote clients will have to communicate with the server to write their news to the bulletin
board and also to read the news from the bulletin board.

**Configuration**

> This program will read a configuration file from system.properties and start up the system accordingly
> [JSCH library](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.jcraft/jsch/0.1.52) is needed
